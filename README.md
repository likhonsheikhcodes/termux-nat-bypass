# üåê **Termux NAT Bypass** üöÄ

**Termux NAT Bypass** is a powerful and secure toolkit designed to **expose your local services** to the internet, bypassing NAT/firewall restrictions. This tool leverages **Tor**, **Ngrok**, and **Tmate** for secure, anonymous access to your Termux services with just a few commands.

## üöÄ Features

- **Bypass NAT**: Seamlessly expose local services from behind NAT/firewalls.
- **Onion Services**: Secure your services with Tor, ensuring full privacy.
- **Ngrok Tunneling**: Expose local servers with a public URL for secure remote access.
- **Tmate Session Sharing**: Share your Termux session easily with remote collaborators.

## üì¶ Installation Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository to your Termux environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/likhonsheikhcodes/termux-nat-bypass.git
   cd termux-nat-bypass

2. Run the Automated Installer
Run the installation script to set up Tor, Ngrok, and Tmate:

bash install.sh


3. Set Up Tor
The script will configure Tor for you, including an Onion service for SSH. Once installed, you can find the Onion address by running:

cat ~/.tor/hidden_ssh/hostname

This will output something like: g3yv3tvqrbow7koz.onion


4. Set Up Ngrok
You'll need to authenticate Ngrok by entering your Ngrok token. Once the script is completed, you‚Äôll get a public URL for your SSH service.


5. Set Up Tmate
Share your Termux session securely with others using Tmate. Once installed, run:

tmate

You will get a unique link to share your session with remote users.



üõ†Ô∏è Usage

Once installed and configured, you can:

Access via Tor: Use the Onion service to access your SSH service securely.

Expose via Ngrok: Access your SSH service using a public URL generated by Ngrok.

Share via Tmate: Share your session with collaborators using the Tmate link.
